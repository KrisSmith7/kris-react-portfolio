# kris-react-portfolio

  ## Description
  This purpose of this project was to create a portfolio displaying my web development skills to date. 
  
  Application loads once with a landing page that will uses ```useEffect``` & ```setTimeout``` to automatically transition to the "about me" page when site first renders. Users can visit "about me", "portfolio", "contact", and "resume" pages without reloading site.
  
  
  The project uses React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and Node.js.
